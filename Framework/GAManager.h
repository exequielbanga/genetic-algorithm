/**
 `GAManager` is the main class of the genetic algorithm model made by Codika.
 Using its instances you can manage a genetic algorithm process in a declarative way, just saying wich algorithms you will use for crossing, selecting and mutating the individuals. You will also find process properties like number of iteration, aptitudeThreshold and the population itself.
 In order to start the process you have to call the 'start' method. Once finished, the process will call 'finishBlock' wich will receive the finalPopulation and the bestIndividual from that population.
